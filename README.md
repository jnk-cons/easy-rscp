# easy-rscp 

easy-rscp is an INOFFICIAL library written in Kotlin (fully Java compatible) for accessing E3DC home power plants.

If you are looking for a TypeScript or JavaScript library, take a look at [easy-rscp-js](https://github.com/jnk-cons/easy-rscp-js).

E3DC is a brand of HagerEnergy Gmbh ([website](https://www.e3dc.com/)). I have nothing to do with the company, except that I own a home power plant from E3DC and wanted to include it in my SmartHome. This "desire" gave birth to easy-rscp.

## Special thanks

The RSCP protocol is virtually undocumented and there is no help available from E3DC.
This library would not have been possible without numerous other projects. I would like to highlight two projects and two people in particular.

First of all, a big "thank you" to Stefan. The developer of the incredible iOS [my4E](https://www.my4e.de/).
Although he himself had no benefit from answering my questions about the RSCP protocol, he did it anyway and was a great help!
Not a matter of course.

A lot of inspiration and also help in understanding the RSCP protocol came from Uli. The developer of the [E3DC plugin](https://github.com/git-kick/ioBroker.e3dc-rscp) for ioBroker. Many thanks for the support.
